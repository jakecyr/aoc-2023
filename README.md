# Advent of Code 2023

## Install

1. Make sure poetry is installed with `pip install poetry`
2. Run `poetry install`
3. Run a specific day solution in "aoc" directly. Example `python aoc/day_1.py`

## Tests

Run `poetry run pytest`

## Setup New Day

Run `./setup.sh 3` replacing `3` with the day number. A new file will be created in "aoc" with a template along with a test file in the "tests" folder.
